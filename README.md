# Web-Scraping-and-Analysis-of-Job-Postings
I have developed a Python project for web scraping job postings using Selenium. It extracts job title, company, location, skills, and posted date, then cleans and analyzes the data to identify most in-demand skills. Includes visualizations like top skills, top companies, job locations, and a skills word cloud with city-wise insights.
